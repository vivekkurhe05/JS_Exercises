/**
 * isNaN() method checks if the resulting value is NaN directly or indirectly.
 * isNaN() converts the value to a number first before testing it.
 * 
 * use Number() constructor to guess the result of isNaN() function just to understand how it works
 * e.g. Number('123') if the result is NaN, then it's true else it's false.
 * In this case it is false.
 * 
 * 
 * Number(value) -> should be NaN
 * 
 * if the above condition is met, it returns true
 * 
 * isNaN('hello') -> true
