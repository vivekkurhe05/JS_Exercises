//  82. Write a JavaScript to add two positive integers without carry. - done

// 83. Write a JavaScript to find the longest string from a given array of strings. -  done

// 84. Write a JavaScript to replace each character of a given string by the next one in the English alphabet.
// Note: 'a' will be replace by 'b' or 'z' would be replaced by 'a'. - done

// 87. Write a JavaScript program to check whether two arrays of integers of same length are similar or not. 
// The arrays will be similar if one array can be obtained from another array by swapping at most one pair of elements. - done

// 89. Write a JavaScript program to check whether it is possible to replace $ in a given expression x $ y = z 
// with one of the four signs +, -, * or / to obtain a correct expression.
// For example x = 10, y = 30 and z = 300, we can replace $ with a multiple operator (*) to obtain x * y = z

// 91. Write a JavaScript program to find the maximum possible sum of some of its k consecutive numbers 
// (numbers that follow each other in order.) of a given array of positive integers.

// 94. Write a JavaScript program to find the number which appears most in a given array of integers.

// 97. Write a JavaScript program to find the shortest possible string which can create a string 
// to make it a palindrome by adding characters to the end of it.

// 101. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a given string contains only Latin letters 
// and no two uppercase and no two lowercase letters are in adjacent positions.

// 102. Write a JavaScript program to find the number of inversions of a given array of integers.
// Note: Two elements of the array a stored at positions i and j form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j.

// 103. Write a JavaScript program to find the maximal number from a given positive integer
//  by deleting exactly one digit of the given number.

// 104. Write a JavaScript program to find two elements of the array such that their absolute difference is not 
// greater than a given integer but is as close to the said integer.

// 105. Write a JavaScript program to find the number of times to replace a given number with 
// the sum of its digits until it convert to a single digit number.
